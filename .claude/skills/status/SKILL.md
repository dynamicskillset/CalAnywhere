Give a quick progress snapshot of the current session.

1. List what has been completed so far in this session.
2. State the current task in progress.
3. List what's remaining before the session goal is done.
4. Flag any blockers or decisions needed.

Keep it concise — bullet points only, no prose. This should be readable in under 30 seconds.
