Capture lessons and patterns from this session.

1. **New discoveries:** What did you learn about the codebase that wasn't previously documented? Add to CLAUDE.md if significant.
2. **Mistakes:** Did any errors occur that could recur? Add an entry to MISTAKES.md using the format: `Date | Error | Root Cause | Prevention`.
3. **Patterns:** Did you find a useful pattern or approach that should be standardised? Document it in CLAUDE.md under a relevant section.
4. **State changes:** Did any component's status change? Update STATE.md accordingly.
5. **Plan updates:** Did anything affect the roadmap? Update PLAN.md if priorities or decisions changed.

Run through each of these, making updates to the relevant files. Keep entries concise.
