Orient yourself at the start of a new session.

1. Read HANDOFF.md to understand what was accomplished last session and what's next.
2. Read STATE.md to get the current status of all components.
3. Run `git status` and `git log --oneline -5` to confirm the current branch and any uncommitted changes.
4. Summarise in 3-5 bullet points: what was done, what's next, and any blockers to be aware of.
5. Ask if there's anything specific to focus on, or proceed with "what's next" from HANDOFF.md.
